A neural network I'm making for a class assignment

* This neural network is a project for a class I'm taking at Northern Kentucky University, Artificial Intelligence, taught by Richard Fox.
* I'm using the book Make Your Own Neural Network by Tariq Rashid as my main guide for making this neural network.  (http://amzn.to/2oWmp32)
* We also use the book Artificial Intellience: Structures and Strategies for Complex Problem Solving 6th edition, by George Luger. (http://amzn.to/2nYBIr3)
* If you are taking the same course, I'm sure Mr. Fox would appreciate it if you do not copy this code!
